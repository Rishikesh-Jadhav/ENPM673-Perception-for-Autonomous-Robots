Q2.2b.RANSAC.py - Output- Graph of pc1,pc2 datasets using RANSAC
results- This subfolder consists of the screenshots of the results of the assignment for each question. 


NOTE: Make sure while testing code the ball video and datasets are in the same directory as the .py files.
	(I have used VSC for writing this code so I recommend you use the same to test the code)

For Running the code you need the following packages
numpy 
matplotlib.pyplot 
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
